## Poss√≠veis erros
If appears the following error in your terminal:
```
'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
You need to add pip on your PATH variable, for this you just need to execute the command below:
```
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Python37\Scripts
```
*Note: If your python interpreter was at other version or been in another path, modify the command.*
